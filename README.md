# Ray Casting

This is a test run for implementing shadow-style logic into my [Uhmong-Us Project](https://github.com/Lance-Easley/Uhmong-Us). 
The code is translated from [Ncase's JavaScript Implementation](https://ncase.me/sight-and-light/) into Python. 
I did this separate from my Uhmong-Us project for two reasons. 
One, I wanted to make sure that I could actually translate the code over without running the risk of dirtying the project up.
Two, Ncase's code works with viewing the whole play area and changing based on the mouse's position.

For Uhmong-Us, I need this system to work with my "camera" system.
Having a clean translation to Python before merging with Uhmong-Us would be much easier than translating and implementing at the same time.
